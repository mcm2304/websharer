I have enhanced the preview box to include essential information, such as the publication date and author's name, for users seeking relevant article details. For instance, you can view this added information on web pages like this [online article](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-biden-hospital-d9606e0ead1f8c4e9fd00b602ed14a38)

To create a visually appealing presentation, I've centered the content within the preview box and made the box larger, which looks better and improves readability. Additionally, I've incorporated a beige background color to enhance the visualization of the content for readers. Furthermore, I've applied a border radius to the preview box, giving it slightly rounded corners for a more aesthetically pleasing appearance.

You can experience this improved preview on my [website](https://website-sharer-ek5d.onrender.com/) hosted and deployed on render.com.

For this assignment, I conceptually discussed with Joseph Tran the logistics of the assignment before starting it.
